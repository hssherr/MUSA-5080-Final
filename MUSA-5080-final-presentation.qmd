## Who We Are

We are a team of advanced planners, working in tandem to solve Philadelphia's most pressing issues. Our skills span across data analysis, policy analysis, design, and more. We are motivated by questions of justice and seek to blend technical solutions with policy know-how.

## The Problem

In the last year, 13,499 eviction claims have been filed against households in Philadelphia.

-   Eviction fuels cycles of poverty, crime, and neighborhood decline, disproportionately impacting communities of color - especially majority-Black neighborhoods

-   Families facing eviction experience ongoing housing instability, often relocating to lower-quality or disadvantaged areas

## How Eviction Works

## Our Research Question

How can we better predict where evictions will occur, so that we can effectively mobilize resources to prevent them?

-   Allow for the targeted allocation of limited resources
-   Inform policies and programs, especially preventative policies
-   Encourage construction of more affordable housing

## Data Sources and Method

-   Joined by Census tract GEOID and month, using 2020 tracts as the spatial base
-   Trained on 2022-2023 data to predict 2024 outcomes

## Our Model

We used a linear regression model for our prediction for transparency and ease of interpretation. Linear regression worked well with the size of the dataset, standardized nature of measurements, and predictors with known relationships in eviction literature. It is a stable model that avoids over-fitting. Fundamentally, the iterative and transparent nature of our method is optimal for policy-makers and mitigating equity concerns.

## Future Considerations

## Future Considerations

-   Explore impact of policy changes, economic shifts, major events, or shifting social attitudes and wrap into future modeling
-   Include more specific/accurate temporal variables
-   Fold in rolling averages to smooth out the past to help predict the future

## Conclusion

We present Model 6 as our final model:

-   Reduced variable set to include average pre-pandemic eviction filings, percent non-white resident households, crime counts, and lagged eviction counts both by one month and by two months
-   This indicates that crime counts and the past history of evictions in a tract are strong indicators of whether evictions will occur in the future
-   Reinforces that evictions within a community perpetuate cycles of crime, poverty, and disinvestment that only contribute to additional risk of evictions in the future
